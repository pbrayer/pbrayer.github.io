     <p>Sam Reimann is from Eagan, Minnesota. He grew up with one brother and lots of friends. Very popular kid.</p>
     <p>Just kidding! But he wasn't a loser either. He attended SES (School of Environmental Studies) at the Minnesota Zoo for high school.</p>
     <p>After this, he graduated from Hamline University in Saint Paul. Minnesota is home.</p>
     <p>In his free time he enjoys playing video games, exploring breweries in Minneapolis, and discovering new content creators on Twitch.</p>

     <br><p>I have now run out of stuff to talk about and this is mostly just filler text so I can make sure this text goes under the image like the example from the assignment.</p>
